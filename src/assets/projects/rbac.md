# Roles-based User Access Control

![RBAC](/projects/rbac-permission-control.png)

**My role**: Primary designer, Front and back end developer (working with one other developer)

The purpose of this retail software project was to allow administrative users to create and choose custom roles for users. They are able to create a user, assign them a role and a store and send them an activation email.

I was the designer and front-end developer for this project, working with a product manager and back-end developer. I also wrote some back-end code in Django.

### Highlights

- Designed and built a “permissions control” widget using React & Typescript that provides users finer control over a Role's permissions.
- Extensively iterated prototypes over several rounds of tests with users
- Redesigned and handcoded an activation email that changes its messaging based on data such as user role and store
