# Template Designer

![Template Designer](/projects/template-design.png)

Proprietary web-based design software.

**My role**: Lead Designer, later (and ongoing) full-stack developer

This software is designed to allow users to create their own templates to print their paper promotional tickets.

It was recognised that our old desktop-based software posed a business risk, as it was too difficult for clients to effectively use.

I was heavily involved in this project from the outset, collaborating with a senior UX consultant on the initial UI. I then took on the role of sole designer and contributed front end code to the project, tidying up sidebar properties and adding some features.

### Highlights

- We created an entire design app in about 6 months!
- I worked closely with our full-stack developers and was relied upon for questions about how things should work, look and feel
- Designed smart groups: Similar to Flexbox and Figma's auto layout, these allow content to fill up remaining space when other content hasn't been filled in. In our legacy software, this was achieved with complex javascript code.
- Designed complex price fields that allow a user to have fine control over how their dollar and cents symbols should look
