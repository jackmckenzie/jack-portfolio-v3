# Last Yard Blog

![Blog Post example](/projects/blog-post.png)

After having our new website built, we wanted to carry over our blog content from the old website.

**My role**: Sole designer and developer

The quoted price to have it built was out of budget, so I took on the task of developing it in-house. I was able to create the new blog in Storyblok/Typescript in about a week.

### Highlights

- Handwritten blog system including authors, dates, etc
- Familiarised myself with Storyblok, Vercel, Next and headless CMS
