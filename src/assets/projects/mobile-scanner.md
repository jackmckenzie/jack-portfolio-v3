# Mobile Scanner

The mobile scanner was created to help users in-store to replace missing tickets. Through customer feedback and interviews, we discovered that stores would often need to reprint their tickets outside of their usual print runs. This was typically achieved by writing down lengthy barcode numbers, by hand, to be manually entered into Last Yard. I led the design for this feature with a focus on providing speed and accuracy. We ran multiple sessions including extensive user interviews and prototype testing to learn how we could improve these processes and provide a better ticketing experience.

Customer feedback has been highly positive.
