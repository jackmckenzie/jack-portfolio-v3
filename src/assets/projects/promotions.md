# In-store Promotions app

![Promotions](/projects/promotions.png)

**My role**: Full-stack developer

Promotions in Last Yard allow users to finely control how they promote products, specials etc.

The existing system was clunky and in desperate need of an upgrade. It was using old HTML templates from Django and it was very slow to use:

### Highlights

- Converted the old Django app to React
- Wrote brand new APIs with complete testing using Django Rest Framework
- Changed the app to be fully client-side routed using React
- Made the pages fully accessible
