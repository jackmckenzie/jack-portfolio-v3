# Runtime Logs

![Runtime logs](/projects/runtime-log.png)

Error logs for complex business rule functions.

**My role**: Primary designer, full-stack developer

This was a challenging project aimed towards power users of the product. They needed high detail and each log needed to be easy to share.

I created and coded a simple design for this that attempts to "stay out of the way". Users of this tool have found it invaluable in their day to day work.

## Highlights

- Click a log to view more details in a sidebar, with a link to view the log in detail
- Familiarised myself with Django and calling Django APIs from React
